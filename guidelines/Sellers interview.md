#### 5. Best practices :
- Pretend to be a buyer moving from Paris to Toulouse for work, and with little knowledge of the area
- Pretend to be a buyer, and at some point that you have some questions because your mother wants to sell and doesn't know if she should use PAP or an Agency
- Pretend to be a student doing research
- Be Honest (you are launching a project and have some questions)
